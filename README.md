# BankingChatBot

Chatbot is an intelligent software which mimics the human behavior, and they make better
human computer interaction .My project is about a banking chatbot which is a quite like a
Chase bank customer service chatbot , it greets and requestâ€™s user a query about their Bank
account then based upon the user input the chatbot responds appropriately .

In this project I implemented chatbot and how a chatbot works and responds based
upon the user inputs. It retrieves the information about the account balance details ,
Frequently Asked Question , statements , card details and ATM information by the chatbot
we used deep learning techniques and chatbot is trained with the help of dataset which
consists of patterns , responses, and certain patterns . where we categories the user input
into class and then gives reply from the pool of responses of the related classes that we
defined it in the intent.json file .
With the help of libraries and modules like Keras , NLTK , Tensorflow for the training of
the data , building a retrieval based chatbot , then we have built a user interface with the
help of the Tkinter using python so that user have a Chatbot window in which it has a
chatlog , message box and send button . so that user can interact with Chatbot along with
the history of the chat in the chatlog

Technologies Used:
For this Project I used Python as primary programming language along with
different libraries and modules like NLTK , Keras , TensorFlow , NumPy , Tkinter .
